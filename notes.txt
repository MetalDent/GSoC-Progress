metal_dent: btw, if you just want to 'reset' the board not program it
you can simply run the pic32prog -d pickit2:04d8:0033:A without a hex file
or, if you want to try a power cycle, you can do 
/usr/local/script/remote_a_ctrl.sh cycle
(with sudo)

minicom -con ACM0

pic32prog /tmp/AXIOM_Remote_Bootloader.hex -d pickit2:04d8:0033:A

pic32prog -d pickit2:04d8:0033:A -e
