metal_dent: btw, if you just want to 'reset' the board not program it
you can simply run the pic32prog -d pickit2:04d8:0033:A without a hex file
or, if you want to try a power cycle, you can do 
/usr/local/script/remote_a_ctrl.sh cycle
(with sudo)

minicom -con ACM0

pic32prog /tmp/AXIOM_Remote_Bootloader.hex -d pickit2:04d8:0033:A

pic32prog -d pickit2:04d8:0033:A -e

start remote -> sudo /usr/local/script/remote_a_ctrl.sh on
start pickit -> sudo /usr/local/script/pickit_b_ctrl.sh on

after using please turn them "off"

RemoteA is PIC32MZ2048ECG (v0.9)
RemoteB is PIC32MZ2048EFH (v0.14)
